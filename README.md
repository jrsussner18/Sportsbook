# NFL Sportsbook

This project involves creating an NFL Sports Book application in Python that utilizes web scraping and the Tkinter library for a graphical user interface. The application allows users to view the spread odds and money lines for all NFL games in the upcoming season, place bets on individual games, and specify the dollar amount for each wager. Users can also calculate the total odds and potential winnings for their bets, and store multiple bets within the sportsbook for easy management. This project combines real-time data collection through web scraping with a user-friendly interface, making it a comprehensive tool for NFL betting enthusiasts.
