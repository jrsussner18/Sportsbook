Day 1: Coming up with project idea -> sportsbook
Goal for day 2: Jake create simple web scrape for sports data

For webscrapin sports data, used Draft kings because of simple layout of website. 
Instead of creating a webscrape for all games, I thought it would be more doable for one day to create a sample of what one game would look like, then automate it with everyone else
When running, it creates new csv files and txt files outside of the repo, i dont know why
