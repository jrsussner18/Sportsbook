Day 1: Coming up with project idea -> sportsbook
Goal for day 2: Jake create simple web scrape for sports data

For webscrapin sports data, used Draft kings because of simple layout of website. 
Instead of creating a webscrape for all games, I thought it would be more doable for one day to create a sample of what one game would look like, then automate it with everyone else
When running, it creates new csv files and txt files outside of the repo, i dont know why

18 hour video for tkinter that I(Matthew) am currently going through at a fairly slow pace.

(Sam) I started the GUI. The csv file and GUI are linked but I am still working on a few things...

    - Getting user input and using that to populate the specific games and buttons 
      (I have a start on this by getting the user to type in the Entry box, but I can't figure out how to convert that into an int)

    - Also, the spacing is sorta messed up becasue I currently want my Entry box on line 10 and it is stuck right under the labels and 
      buttons

Aug 11 notes
- Updated GUI
  - Grid locations for buttons and labels
  - Cleaned up GUI code
- Added weeks to the csv

Problems/corner cases (need to solve) - (Sam)

- Buttons on my screen don't show up a different color after I click them
- Buttons on my screen don't have a background color

- Buttons not permenitly selected after they have been clicked on
    - For example, I click on a button in week 7, go to week 8, bet on a game in week 8, come back to week 7 and I can click the same button I already clicked on

- When GUI is opened, week 1 field is blank

- Titles off centered

Aug 15 notes
- Added a textbox for a parlay buildup
- added a textbox for final Odds

- Fixed GUI bugs
  - When week was changed, whole GUI went blank
  - odds were not following from week to week

- More bugs to fix:
  - When changing weeks, disabled buttons need to stay disabled
  - Maybe make it so that you cannot bet on the ML if already betting on the spread of the same game? (Maybe not)

- More things to add:
  - Set up a monetary system to actually make bets
  - Send already made bets to a separate txt or csv file
  - Make it personalized, so that your bets follow only you
  - Make it able to access already made bets within the GUI

August 21 Notes:

- Things to do:
  - fix diabled button bug
